problem: For many folks who have had run-ins with the criminal justice system, punishment doesn't end with the end of their sentence. Well past the period of incarceration, a criminal conviction can follow a person around for the rest of their life, preventing them from accessing housing, employment, and services which might otherwise help them integrate back into society.
proposal: Create a form and decision tree to help expungement providers at the Multnomah County Public Defender's office quickly determine which items on an applicant's record are eligible for expungement.
status: Completed
