This site is built with Jekyll, a simple, easy to use static site generator.


## Description

## Project Layout
 - File Organization is similar to any other project built with Jekyll with the following organization for html and asset files

The main page has different sections. Each section has its own file for html, and assets (css, images, js).

For example lets look at the Products section. The relevant html and asset files for the products section can be found here:

- HTML file: `sections/products.html`
- CSS file: `assets/stylesheets/products.scss`
- Images dir: `assets/images/products/*`
- Javascript dir: `assets/javascript/products/*`
 
Products is a collection and each individual product can be found in its collection directory. Jekyll will look for the products collection in the directory `_products` by default. Inside that directory you'll find each product and the data that is used to build the secion.
