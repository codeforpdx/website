problem: The nonprofit JOIN helps transition people out of homelessness. However, their system for staying in touch with landlords is currently inadequate.
proposal: Create an app with a robust ticketing system to ensure JOIN staff can connect with their landlords and clients when an issue arises. This will allow JOIN to provide support and improve success in transitioning people out of homelessness.
