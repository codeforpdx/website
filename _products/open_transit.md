problem: American public transit used to be the envy of the world, but has fallen behind in recent decades. Good public transit is essential to reducing income inequality, improving sustainability, and increasing accessibility.
proposal: Use historical transit data to help riders and city planners understand the quality of bus, light rail, and streetcar lines. Currently offered in San Francisco and being adapted for PDX and beyond!
status: On Hold
