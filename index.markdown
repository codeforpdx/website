### Local Civic Innovators and Creative Problem-Solvers.

We are civic-minded residents committed to working with the City of Portland, Multnomah County and other municipalities in the greater Portland area – as well as other nonprofit organizations – to make our region stronger. We’re here to help and eager to learn from professional public servants. And while we’re advocates for open government (we can’t build apps without open data!), we’re non-partisan and public-minded.

We're a group of civic-minded coders, public-employees, designers, and extraordinary citizens. We work in partnership with government, non-profit, and technical partners to deploy technology to improve quality of life for all residents and increase citizen engagement with civic issues.

Ultimately, our goal is to make life better for residents by improving personal and collective outcomes through helping build local government services that are better, faster, and cheaper and have the greatest impact for the greatest amount of people who have the greatest need for assistance and efficient public services.

### Executive Leadership

Code for PDX is led by an Executive Leadership Team that organizes events, manages strategic partnerships, and ensures fluid communication among cross-functional project teams. The Executive Team oversees volunteer management, organizational sustainability, day-to-day operations, and the engagement of the Advisory Board.
